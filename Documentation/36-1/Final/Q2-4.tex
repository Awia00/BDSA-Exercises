\section{Q2-4}
\emph{Draw a use case diagram for a ticket distributor for a train system. The system includes two actors: a traveler who purchases different types of tickets, and a central computer system that maintains a reference database for the tariff. Use cases should include
BuyOneWayTicket, BuyWeeklyCard, BuyMonthlyCard, and UpdateTariff. Also include the following exceptional cases: TimeOut (i.e., traveler took too long to insert the right amount), TransactionAborted (i.e., traveler selected the cancel button without completing the transaction), DistributorOutOfChange, and DistributorOutOfPaper.}
\\
\emph{Remember that a use case diagram consists of both the sticky man diagram as well as the use cases written in text using the template on p. 45 in OOSE. }
