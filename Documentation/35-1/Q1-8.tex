In the following description, explain when the term account is used as an application domain concept and when as a solution domain concept:
	“Assume you are developing an online system for managing bank accounts for mobile customers. A major design issue is how to provide access to the accounts when the customer cannot establish an online connection. One proposal is that accounts are made available on the mobile computer, even if the server is not up. In this case, the accounts show the amounts from the last connected session.”

"Assume you are developing an online system for managing bank accounts for mobile customers"
This sentence is in the application domain, because it does not go in into details with how the system needs to work, but explains system requirements.

"A major design issue is how to provide access to the accounts when the customer cannot establish an online connection."
This is stillin the application domian because it explains problems that the users encounter even without the system.

"One proposal is that accounts are made available on the mobile computer, even if the server is not up." 
This sentence is in the solution domain. It goes into detail as with servers and how the systems can solve a specific problem.

"In this case, the accounts show the amounts from the last connected session.”
This sentence is clearly in the solution domain as it explains how a solution in the system can be created.
