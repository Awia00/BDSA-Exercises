\section{Q1-2} 
A programming language is a notation for representing algorithms and data structures. List two advantages and two disadvantages of fusing a programming language as the sole notation throughout the development process.\\

\emph{Advantages:}
\begin{quote}
By only using a programming language, you can quickly produce a prototype than if you had to dedicate time to documentation and planning. 
This jumpstarts the iteration process which allows the developers to test, find bugs and improve where needed.
Another advantage is that when working on small projects, simply producing the code is cost- and timeefficient.

\emph{Disadvantages:}
\begin{quote}
When not documenting, extendability and maintainability becomes much more difficult - especially if there isn't a sole developer as the code might not be easily readable.

Another disadvantage is that you easily can lose the overview of your project, by for example not using UML-diagrams. 

By only writing code and not communicating with the customer, the program can easily become unsatisactory for the customer (no validation).
