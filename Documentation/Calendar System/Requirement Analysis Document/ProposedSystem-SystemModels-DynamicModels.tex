\subsubsection{Sequence Diagrams}
In this section, sequence diagrams have been created from our use cases. We have the following sequence diagrams:\\

\subsubsection{State Machine Diagrams}
In this section, state machine diagrams have been created for some of the objects described in the initial object analysis. Some of the diagrams have states where they wait for the other object to respond. In these cases the state will be named as following: ObjectNameState.\\
