\subsection{Initial object analysis}
The table describes the predicted classes and their purpose and relations. This will be elaborated on when the class diagram will be added in assignment 38.

\textbf{Analysis Object Model (Static Model):}\\
This table contains our Entity, Control and Boundry objects, that are being used in our system, at the moment.
These objects are being used to make our class diagram\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l | l | l}

Entity    	& Control 			& Boundry 		\\
\toprule
Event     	& CreateCalendarEntry	& CalendarView	\\
Calendar	& UpdateCalendarEntry	& EventView 		\\
User		& ChangeOverviewType	& NoticeView		\\
Notification	& ChooseTag			& LoginView		\\
Tag		& CreateTag			&			\\
		& SetNotification		&			\\
		& GetNotification		&			\\		
		& CreateHistoryReport	&			\\
		& CancelEntry		&			\\
		& Login			&			\\		
		
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}\\
\\

This is our class diagram. All our Entity, Control and Boundry objects are represented in our class diagram, 
and our class diagram shows how our objects are connected to each other.\\
