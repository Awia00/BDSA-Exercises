\section{Boundary conditions}
When looking at the data storage a boundary use case stands clear. If the storage must be able to save data locally and in the cloud(online database), the storage must have a method which can check for data integrity between the two, such that the online database at all possible time has the newest data.\\

When looking at the start and shutdown of the system, making sure that data is saved and retrieved to/from the available storage(optimally the online database).
