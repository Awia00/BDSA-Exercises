\section{Purpose of the system}
The purpose of the Calendar system is to have a standard client-server calendar system like MS Exchange or iCal. The system must provide the user with the ability to save, edit events and be able to retrieve their calendar on any computer with the system installed. The system should furthermore provide the user with multiple kinds of overviews of the events he has planned, and prompt the user with a notification if an event has a notification time.\\
