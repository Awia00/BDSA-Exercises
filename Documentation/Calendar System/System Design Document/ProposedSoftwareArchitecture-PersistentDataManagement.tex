\section{Persistent data management}
To save the data in form of events, tags and so on, an online database connection will be used. The database gives access to data quickly and from multiple locations. The problem with this solution is that it requires an internet connection. To work around this a strategy design pattern can be implemented to provide the application the possibility to store data locally if no connection is available and vice. versa. \\
To peek, post, update, delete LINQ can be used since it supports these features in a strong cross storage-platform language.
