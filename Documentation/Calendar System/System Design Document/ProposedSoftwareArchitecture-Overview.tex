\section{Overview}

\textbf{View subsystem:}
This subsystem contains the different types of views that will show, depending on how the user is 
using the system. Therefore, its assignment of functionality will be that this subsystem 
has to keep track of the different views.\\

\textbf{Model subsystem:}
This subsystem contains the data that the system will be using. When the model changes state, 
it will notify the controllers, and the controllers will then change the view. Therefore, 
this subsystems assignment of functionality will be notifying the controllers, 
when its state is being changed.\\

\textbf{Controller subsystem:}
This subsystem is being used to update the views, by receiving the models state. 
Its assignment of functionality will be that this subsystem will have to update the views 
with the received models state.\\

\textbf{DataStorage subsystem:}
This subsystem contains a database storage. Users gain accesss to this database storage through an interface.
Therefore, its assignment of functionality of this subsystem will be to store data, which will be used at a later time.
