Upon starting the program, the user is prompted with the loginView. Prior to the password being authenticated the CalendarSystem will proceed to load data belonging to the user. When the data has loaded, the CalendarView is initialized.
The user can then interact with the system in multiple ways. For instance, the user can create/update or remove an event. This is then handled by the InputController, which will register the users activity and then load it in to the CalendarSystem. In the background this recent activity will be stored in to the database. When a change is committed, the CalendarView will then observe this, and the model will then proceed to update the view.
