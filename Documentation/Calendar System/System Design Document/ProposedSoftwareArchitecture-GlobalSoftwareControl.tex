\section{Global software control}
%To ensure safe threading, concurrent data access some design choices have to be made therefore:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The boundary objects in the view subsystem should not define any fields or change any data only show it. Therefore the view should only handle temporary objects or simple data types from the objects.
%\item Classes should provide getters and setters for their objects, but never allow for direct access to the field.
%\end{itemize}
