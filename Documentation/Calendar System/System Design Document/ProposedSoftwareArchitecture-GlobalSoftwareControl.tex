\section{Global software control}
The flow of our system would be a Proceduce-driven control, and the reason for this, is that the program will follow specific prodecures, depending on how the user is interacting with the system.\\

Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted with a login view, whereas the login will be used to receive a specific calendar, that is being stored in our database. The user can't access any calendar if he or she hasn't logged in, since the system wouldn't know which calendar that belongs to the user.
For login in, the InputController of our Controller Subsystem will be using the information entered into our login view to authenticate the information, and if the authentication is a success, our DataStorage Subsystem will access the database and receive the specific calendar belonging to the user, and our Model Subsystem will then observe the DataStorage and update its state, whereafter the CalendarView, from our View Subsystem, will be initialized and show the data received from the database.\\

The user can then interact with the system in multiple ways. For instance, the user can create/update or delete an event. These activities will be handled by the InputController, which will register the users activity, update the state of the Model and then load it into the CalenderView. In the background, recent activity will be stored in the database, as the user is still using the system. If a change is commited, the model will update its own state, whereafter the CalenderView will be updated by the ViewController.\\
